# Physics Simulations using Python

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates
how fundamental physics equations can be translated into
executable simulations using Python.

## Simulations Included
1. Projectile Motion
2. Simple Harmonic Motion
3. Damped Harmonic Oscillator

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## How to Run
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Open the notebook:
jupyter notebook physics_simulations.ipynb

## Purpose
This project demonstrates physics reasoning, mathematical
modelling, and clean Python implementation — skills required
for physics-focused AI and research roles.
